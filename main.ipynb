We aggregate the statistics on male and female artists for each bin. The counts for 12 or more genres are grouped together so that the $\\chi^2$-test can be applied (using the requirement that the expected count in each cell of the contingency table should be at least 50). Furthermore, there are no female artists with 12 or more genres in the data set, a fact which is of interest in itself in the exploration of gender bias."
